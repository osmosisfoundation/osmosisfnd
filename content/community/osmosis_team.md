## Meet our Community

OsMoSiS is entirely a community driven effort. The project originally came together from conversations between like-minded researchers and continues to expand as more people contribute tools, expertise, and research ideas. We welcome a global community of researchers, students, software developers, and various others working towards improving the world of quantitative clinical science. We welcome you to join us and help improve tools and practices available to researchers.

## How to join our community
