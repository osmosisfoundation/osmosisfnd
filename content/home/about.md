# Building an Open and Collaborative Society

OsMoSiS is an community driven effort with the goal of developing tools and resources for the modeling and simulation scientists in quantitative clinical and systems pharmacology and the many sub-disciplines in pharmacometrics.

Open Science, powered by open source tools fosters the availability of scientific research - data & methods, code & software, results & publications, readily accessible to every individual in the community. Widespread practice of open science in pharmacometrics and related quantitative clinical sciences is currently held back due to the lack of powerful tooling that is freely accessible. Pharmacometrics is seeing a slow but steady rise of open source advocates and champions in the community along with powerful platforms for research sharing such as the DDMore model repository, the Pharmacometrics Study Groups and conference discussions regarding the need for open source solutions.

OsMoSiS is an idea born out of the rising momentum and need for open source tooling and culture in quantitative clinical sciences. The goal of OsMoSiS is to narrow the gap between what is good for individual researchers and the scientific community. OsMoSiS has a expert collaborative team from academia, industry and the regulators from different parts of the world that will work towards a common strategic plan.
